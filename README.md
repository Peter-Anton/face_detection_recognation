# Face Detection and Recognition with OpenCV DNN and Inception V3
This repository contains code for face detection and recognition using OpenCV's DNN module and transfer learning with Inception V3. The model is trained on kaggle and saved as an `.h5` file, which is then used for real-time face detection and recognition using a live camera feed.
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Peter-Anton/face_detection_recognation
   cd face-detection-recognition
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Ensure you have OpenCV and other necessary libraries installed:
    ```bash
    
        pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless

4. run the face detection and recognation.ipynb

5. Run test2.py to start face detection and recognition using your webcam and the .h5 file that you save:

      ```bash

   python test2.py
# here is an image to test the mode:
